# intro-to-js
A simple talk introducing people to Javascript

## Getting Started
Use the `main.js` file in the root directory as your guide. Each section is commented out, and will need to be uncommented to run.
I would use [repl](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) to run your code.

## Current Topics Covered

- Comments
- Variables
- Hello World!
- Control Flow (loops, if, switch case)
